You sound like Chicken Little.
Ever have one of those days?
Wait a second, I can't remember if we're covered under Medicare part A, GG, or D train!!
I certainly don't know what could be worse than the construction dust?
And then it hit me...
And then she told me I would die a terrible death.
C'mon Bob! Your always off dreaming...never noticing the little things... it's sad.
I don't know what's come over me. I'm such a blockhead!
When the boss called me into his office I thought I was getting promoted, but he just wanted me to sign "the sky is falling' waiver they're implementing soon...
Son of a bitch!
I don’t care what you’re trying to say, it’s rude to talk with your mouth full.
For some reason I just have no interest in this presidential race.
I specifically requested a second lump.
Tinder is amazing...I'm meeting Cindy Block here in a few seconds.
Oh, I thought you meant the B train. But, we're only off by a little bit.
My mental block's a killer.
I can't shake this sense of impending doom.
Didn't you tell her to use Dropbox?
Would it be so terrible if you looked at me while we are having a serious conversation?
Karma's a what?
It's time we talked about the anvil in the coffee shop.
I forgot to mention, I sign the life insurance papers tomorrow.
Is that an Acme brick?
Seriously, I'm having some kind of block.
Please don't tell me he's standing right behind me.
Why am I so lousy in the market? Maybe it'll hit me.
Hey buddy...nevermind
Any final thoughts?
My shrink suggested that I fast-track my upstairs renovation and enjoy it longer.
My doctor said I have six months to live.
It doesn't seem like a serious threat. I'm sure it will fizzle out soon.
...interesting question... is there anything super quick to do on my bucket list...
At least now I have a reason to be late to work.
You're really eating their heart attack special?
The Cubs are going to win it all.
Brink and mortar businesses will figh back
If a new idea doesn't strike me soon, this writer's block is going to kill me!
Do you think I should've ordered the healthy start?
How does my hair look?
I've got a crushing headache.
I can feel my luck running out.
I expect the sword of Damocles to fall at any moment.
Nah, a light bulb isn't pragmatic. It isn't achievable. At least with a cinder block, you know what you're getting.
You ever get the feeling that the whole world's out to get you?
I could have sworn I ordered a cinder block...
I just need a lucky break.
I just need to complete their customer satisfaction survey.
I'm telling you, it hit me like a brick.
It just hit me - it's either her or me.
What's more apparent? The fragment that will open you up or the arbiter's ersatz sentence?
Yeah. When your name is Damocles, things like this just tend to happen.
You know those doughnuts are gonna kill you.
I think I just found the answer to your problems . . .
Hey, guess who getting your corner office? Me.
If it's a sin to support Trump...
Gravity? Pssh, it's just a theory!
I keep a lid on my coffee so it won't get spilled.
With my bad luck, they'll have forgotten the cream.
I told you we should wait until the glue dries.
There's something missing from my boiler-maker.
Don't worry so much, Sid; it'll never happen.
If I only could block out those feelings.
I'm lucky. I never get headaches.
I'm told this place is an acquired taste.
My doctor recommends I cut back on the gluten.
That's going to leave a mark
This seemed like a much better idea when we were drinking.
I think we should have lunch together more often!
Finally, I feel like nothing is just hanging over me anymore.
This one's on you!!
Mind your own business.
I always take one lump with my coffee.
So I asked myself, what could be worse?
Hah! My horoscope says “Avoid coffee today.”
Matt, I've always loved you.
I'm the luckiest man in the world...
Bob, do you believe in predestination?
George? God, you always tune out during the heavy stuff.
I feel good. Like there is nothing hanging over my head anymore.
That coffee will knock you out!
Oops! I am afraid you could be right about your suspicion on your wife reading your e-mails
You can get "smashed" drinking this coffee!
'I don't think you appreciate the gravity of this situation.'
My password is...
I think the management welcomed my criticism of the macchiato.
I'll get the check!
Can you give me a concrete example?
I am going to go to my grave with the recipe for grandma's secret sauce.
O.K., confession time.
I don't tip
It's true when your numbers up it's up!!!
Then, out of thin air, she drops the 'D' word on me!
Nice!
One more wouldn't hurt
Could you be a little more descriptive other than "The sky is falling" ?
Hey! Look here. The climate'll be just fine, and so will I.
hello
Things are looking up. I can feel it.
Did you see her face when I asked for a fifth cup of coffee?
No more drinks for me, I feel a headache coming on.
After admitting the shortcuts we took building this place, I feel like a great weight has been taken off my shoulders.
Fred's realization hit him like a, well...you know....
My wife says I've become a doom and gloom Republican. What the hell does she know?
I'll pass on lunch. I think I'm coming down with something.
Eight years since the crash and I finally feel like my luck is changing.
I need a concrete idea.
So I tell them to calm down; The sky is not falling.
Now would be a good time to pay the check!
My therapist says I keep putting women on a pedestal and then the world comes crashing down on me.
Remember when you said it would rain cinder blocks before Trump became the nominee?
I can't believe how lucky I am to have pulled off this deal.
It's time to go!
Did you ask for one lump or two?
I feel a headache coming on!
Please hold that thought.
Did you ever get that feeling, like finally, your ship has come in?
Brady's better than Manning? What are you, a block head?
I can't put my finger on it, but I just have this sense of impending doom.
You should keep the cover on so you don't spill it
What makes you think our luck will turn?
My philosophy has always been to expect the unexpected
I guess He heard me.
I don't get "interesting" surprises.
It's rude to talk with your mouth full.
Trump, why?
Just once I'd like to receive a "heads up" about something ahead of time.
Speaking of last minute things.
Yep, I never seen it coming.
I signed up on this new reminder app.
Yes Dan, it's some heavy stuff...and I'm pretty sure it's headed your way, so ready for it.
Got one of those standing desks. Gonna add years to my life.
Why the look, you know I like my coffee with just one lump.
It's true; I always have to have the last word.
So you really didn't mind my getting the promotion?
God help me, I neglected to stir my coffee.
Herdy!! What? Eh, nevermind.
I quit drinking, and I haven't had a headache in weeks.
My horoscope said I was lucky today.
And today, I pick up my big fat Lotto check.
A half-million term. Why?
We need a more concrete plan.
So I made an anti-cementic remark. Big deal.
The coffee here is to die for.
I think things are finally falling into place.
I think God's telling me to vote for Trump.
Falling cinder blocks I can tolerate, but the severed finger pointing at my coffee is really creeping me out.
You might want to change your position
Speaking of "building blocks"......
I'll let you know when I have some concrete information for you.
My palm reader said I should have my head examined.
My early retirement plan has severe penalties
If I'm lying, I'm dying!
I had an important point to make, but I didn't actually mean to hit you over the head with it.
What you don't know won't hurt you as much.
I was waiting for a shoe .. , but ... .
I'll be brief.
What's cheaper whole life or term.
What's wrong? You look like you just saw a falling block of concrete.
Actuarially speaking, I've got another good 40 years ahead of me.
It's the house decaf, but the first sip still gives you that big caffeine hit.
You'll never believe where I hid all that cash...
Apparently,... things are looking up.
Can't remember. Mental block.
Now, according to Newton, feathers and bricks fall at the same rate. But if one were to hit you . . .
I fired the contractor.
So lately I've been having this sense of doom.
Then it just hit me from out of the blue.
S&P Futures are plummeting. I predict a catastrophic day ahead.
I've requested drone delivery for all materials.
My doctor says caffeine will kill me. I think he's wrong.
Sometimes I think inevitability is a very hazy concept.
I'm telling you, bricks and mortar commerce will disappear in our lifetime.
At least I still have my health.
Listen, I need that fifty dollars you owe me. Quickly.
My treat.
remember how you said work gave you a headache
I'm a cartoonist. What do you do?
I'm predicting a major crash.
I'll be honest, I have my reservations about today's reservation.
I know I can't wait for something to just drop on my head.
Son, if you work hard, you get rewarded. Luck has nothing to do with it.
It's just a matter of time before Jones is out and one of us takes his place.
Hmm, If I pretend to sneeze maybe they will comp the bill.
.....and the gold is in the....
I know the guy has a murderous attitude, but he did say he would drop in.
For once, I'd like to get a concrete answer.
Are you trying to scare me ?
Yes I did say the food here is to die for.
My insurance company? It used to be New England Life. Why?
You can die if you keep eating that stuff!
I just didn't see it coming . . .
Tell me it doesn't say "writer's" on it.
I predicted the last financial crash. I will pull out of the markets sooner rather than later.
Thankfully, it's only a metaphor.
No, I haven't really ever thought about the fleeting nature of our existence. Why?
His wife is quite a babe, no kids ...
Timing is everything ??
Can't wait to get the lid of this new Iron Brew drink Bill, they says it's made with girders!
Last night I had chicken under a brick and....
That sandwich is going to hit you like a falling cinderblock.
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
Should I be concerned about my future at the firm?
My horoscope says I'll get word from higher-ups today.
So, the cure for cancer is ...
Also, I'm worried all this coffee will kill me.
So...what's up?
I was just fired , now what?
Don't look up.
Well, Jesus was a carpenter, so maybe there's something to Trump being in construction.
Thanks for the pep talk, Sam. Nothing's going to stop me now.
I called him a blockhead...
Do you think I'm too pessimistic?
Herb is such a blockhead.
I'm probably going to get fired. Just kill me now.
I'm dead certain.
I woke up feeling unlucky this morning - I wonder why.
I don't care what my wife says, spending our life savings on those hair plugs has really paid off.
One lump or two...
And then it hits me, figuratively, like a ton of bricks.
Keep you lid on.
Blockhead.
Oh well I guess there';s worse things then being laid off
I feel more validated now that my wife increased my life insurance.
It's not like the literal sky is falling.
I don't know, I just seem to have this weight on my shoulders.
...So after two disastrous marriages, my job being terminated and the BMW being totaled, I think I'm finally out of the woods...
Been selling life insurance for 20 years now. I tell them, "you never know when something might just fall out of the sky on you." Like that ever happens.
Materials to build a wall of that size don't just fall out of the sky, ya know?
You wouldn't believe what my horoscope said today.
I can feel it coming, Eddie. I'm a great songwriter and I know I'm lined up for a really big hit.
look seriously, I don't think you have to worry about that possibility, no one builds floor plates with...
Look … I understood all the dynamics of the problem from the very beginning.
We just need something more concrete to go on...
The latte here is to die for.
My only complaint with this restaurant is that sometimes the food is a little heavy.
No problem - the tab's on me.
I guess I'm not having a bad day after all.
I really liked the last episode of 'The Sopranos'.
Who you callin' a blockhead?
There was something in today's horoscope that I definitely don't understand.
So I said to my wife, sometimes things get worse before they get better.
Don't you know that stuff will kill you?
Sometimes I feel as though the cinder block of Damocles hangs overhead.
Any final thoughts on the matter?
What do you mean things can always be worse?
My Accidental Death and Disability insurance just lapsed. Do you know a good agent?
Nothing could make this day worse for me.
I couldn't afford the sword.
I think there's something wrong with your Fitbit...
I can't believe this. I asked for two lumps with my coffee.
Monday mornings are so boring.
Last confession? Well, certainly before Candy.s Escorts! Why do you ask?
I just can't shake this feeling of impending doom.
We've all had a stale bagel, but this is ridiculous.
Who needs a coffee lid?
5, 4, 3, 2 ...
I find comfort in this rut
If God doesn't want me to do it, then let Him stop me.

Got any concrete ideas?
I want my epitaph to read: 'He passed tort reform.'
This very well could be the Cubs' year.
My boss is a real blockhead
I heard this place is known for its flat white.
I feel like things are finally looking up.
Does Obamacare cover catastrophic injury?
There's only one thing my insurance doesn't cover.
Who calls someone "blockhead" these days?
I need concrete evidence that she's cheating on me.
Can you explain quickly why you're rescinding your life insurance offer?

My ability to accept the absurd has just recently came into conflict with the fact that my personal prayers are seemingly being answered
Seriously? Alan Dershowitz drinks here all the time?
I'm looking forward to an early retirement.
And my decision is set in concrete.

Sometimes I just need a wake-up call.
Who's the Chicken Little now?
Im sorry our cutbacks at OSHA affected you.
So where are we at in our lawsuit against Looney Tunes?
Will? Why would I need a will?
I guess I should have been nicer to that server, but at least she gave me a good seat,
I thought a ton would look a lot bigger.
Meep Meep......"How many times do I have to tell him my name is Willy Coyote!"
I just finally feel like things are becoming more concrete.
Heads Up
Well if you think I'm just gonna sit here and let the world go by, you've got another thing comin' !
Remember the old expression that "the sky is falling! The sky is falling" Well, its true! Duck
Do you believe in luck?
How many lumps did you say you wanted again?
I'll get the next one.
I've finally made my peace with the man upstairs.
And yes, this business plan is absolutely concrete.
Thanks for blocking some time out with me today.
"What I'm about to tell you may save your life."$
Can you keep a secret?
This headache can't get any worse.
There is simply no way to convince me that our job description should require a hardhat.
Finally, everything is looking up for me.
I really like the ambiance here.
Why are you surprised I fired that coyote from the ACME group.
I see buying this shop as a key building block in a financially secure retirement.
Quit ignoring me like I'm some sort of block head.
It's like the sword of Damoclese, only more concrete
"Well, that's a load off my chest. Next?
This may not be the time, but have you ever been hit by a ton of bricks?
I just won the lottery.
Something, anything, to break the routine.
I just can't seem to cement this in my head
She keeps on about the life insurance...
No really, I have the worst luck.
I don't think this day can get any worse.
I need this new job like a need a hole in my head.
So! you think things are suddenly looking up.
The weight of my job is bearing down on me.
I never catch a break
I hear too much caffeine can kill you.
Ever had the feeling the sky is falling?
What's the best thing for a headache?
This is better. We can finally relax and enjoy a quiet cup of coffee.
Yeah I get it. It's not like you've got to hit me with a brick!
If I'm lying, may the Lord strike me down right now.
Why Newton's descendant couldn't improve on his theory.
It was supposed to remind me of our meeting.
say, can you spot me a twenty?
I'm having the best day! I got a pay raise & my wife told me we're expecting. I should go buy a lottery ticket.
WHAT ? NEVER MIND ?
Hey! They finally got my order right!
Being agnostic just means that I don't worry so much anymore.
All I asked was if they liked 'Kinky Boots'.
I don't get irony. It's gotta just hit me over the head.
Life's so monotonous. I wish something interesting would happen.
Well, that's another way to discourage sugary drink consumption.
...there's one right above me isn't there?
I really told them off when I resigned from Acme this morning!
Maybe I shouldn't of yelled at those workers to be quiet.
I may be wrong, but I think this is my lucky day.
My wife thought I needed more life insurance. She's got a good construction job, so I'm not sure why she was so insistent.
Brick and mortar stores are a thing of the past.
Why did the barrista write, "man about to wear concrete block" on mine?
Okay, I will purchase life insurance. Just please stop with the suggestive morbid stories.
That new guy in finance is a boring blockhead.
Last week hit me like a ton of bricks, but I felt like something was missing.
Uh oh, what fresh hell is this?
What she said was scary, but then it was my first experience with a fortune teller.
My problem has always been I'm too theoretical. I just have no talent for concrete thinking!
Edison bulbs are experimental enough for me.
So here's something weird. Last week this street psychic told me, "Beware the Ides of March." I just saw him again and said, "Hey pal, the Ides are come." So, what does he say? "Aye, Julius, but not gone."
Are we being too literal with our benchmarking?
Apparently, God doesn't use lightning bolts indoors.
So, what's the worst that could happen?
And after talking with her, I felt as though a great weight had been lifted off my shoulders....
May God strike me dead.
You're right, you never know.
The main stream media are a bunch of Chicken Littles.
I'm telling you, my life can't get any worse.
Now, about that tax penalty ...
I'm torn between the tuna melt and the BLT.
No, I never read the story of Chicken Little. Why do you ask?
I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I support Trump because he's honest and will make this country gr--
I want something light.
She said that nothing would get through my thick skull. I hope that she's right.
All of a sudden it hit me!
I see the Knicks' practice is going as expected.
Wife left me, lost my job, the dog ran away...what next?
I need another cup of latte like a hole in the head.
Then I told him to go over it brick-by-brick.......
Sometimes you just can't find an anvil on short notice.
I just wish something would hit me that could change my life.
Run!
The competition has hired some wily hotshot to shake things up. Calls himself Coyote.
Those global warming idiots are like chicken little!
Wait- it's Tuesday... let me guess... a cinder block?
I'm not into wills, are you?
You know that feeling when the other shoe is about to drop?
Didn't you order a flat white?
Cinder-fella
I'm having an affair with a hard hats wife.
I'll get the check this time and you can get it the next time.
I swear that this is the last day I am eating here.
We need to go now!
In my last poll, the margin of error is plus or minus one cinder block.
This coffee really is good to the last drop!
The skyway is falling!
Enough with the generalities. Give me a concrete example?
I'm telling you, our infrastructure is crumbling. It's a wonder no one gets hurt.
A month off would be gift from heaven.
So my doctor told me I can't keep eating red meat.
I feel great. Today is the first day of the rest of my life!
And the worst part about the curse is, they wouldn't let me though airport security.
If I don't get some caffeine soon, I'm going to have such a headache.
and that should be the last thing on my list that's hanging over my head...
I need some concrete answers.
You may be right about the bad luck you've been having.
Why in such a hurry for me to sign the bill?
Why do say it's ironic that I'm a building inspector?
I need to tell you something.
I never tip for coffee.
"She said that I was turning into a real blockhead.
The what is falling?
My analyst tells me that I need to change my "Chicken Little" view of the world.
Please hurry and sign.
Sometimes I feel like such a block head.
Never did like you.
Then he called me a blockhead.
Let's put this on your credit card.
That bagel's going to sit like a brick in your stomach.
You know that feeling when it just hits you?
What do you mean I have a hard head? Give me one concrete example.
I only slept with Susan once!
Would you mind trading seats?
I was informed by The New Yorker that I'd be blocked if I submitted an additional "Cartoon Caption Contest" entries.
I'm really glad you picked this place.
This is not our usual power lunch Ted. I hired you for innovative and creative ideas, so far you've come up empty. It's time you come up with one good "concrete" idea, if not....I'm going to have to let you go.
I asked for two lumps and I got one!
You must have had one too many,
Maybe it’s time to retire.
I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
My lunch here always reminds me of Chicken Little.
I guess you really were dying to see me!
When at first you don't succeed...
"Tipping", isn't an exactly science you know!
For the life of me, I can't imagine anything worse than a President Trump.
Then she started blathering on about 'karma'. I mean, what a bunch of nonsense.
At least I get to choose my own provider.
Hollow threats don't impress me.
Maybe, but now is the time to lean back!
I may not be as hard-headed as I appear!
... all of which leaves me searching for some kind of a sign.
I don't think that they accept substitutions on the Early Bird Special.
I'm afraid I'm getting writers block!
Everything in this town is always about up, up, up.
Statistics show, somewhere in the U.S., somebody experiences karma every 10 seconds.
This construction is killing me.
Just because I ordered a little chicken, it doesn't mean the sky is falling.
'Nothing surprises me anymore.'
So I can finally enjoy a nice restaurant for lunch now that I've cancelled my life insurance premium.
Today can't get any worse.
What could be worse than President Trump?
Well at least your rain cloud is gone.
Oh, .... just another 'faux pas' from Trump Construction.
I make my own luck.
Yes, you could say I'm hardheaded. Why?
did you forget to order the HARD HAT AREA signage?
All day it's been like I'm under this cloud.
Why wouldn't I need to worry about my vacation plans?
...I just feel this heavy weight pressing down on me.
I just have a feeling something big is coming my way...you know?
I distinctly remember you telling me to stay on track.
Why are you always such a pessimist?
If Benson's doomsday accounting is correct, I have yet to see a sign.
I forgot this place is 'cash-only.'
So I guess, after all, things are really looking up.
I ordered an orange crush.
Bob "I don't feel safe here..." Jeff "Oh don't worry Bob it is totally safe around here... What were you saying about voting for Donald Trump"

Yes, Obama Care. Why?

My divorce is creating a big headache.
Do you think I need to post a new Tinder photo?
Horoscope - Schmoroscope... I'll be a pragmatist 'til the day I die.
Can we work cooperatively with this union?
The "chicken little special" isn't sitting well with me.
This latte better be worth it.
I can feel it, something big is coming.
TrI bet there is nothing worse than getting your finger stuck in a plastic lid.
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted to start over.
I just feel like I'm due for a life-changing experience.
I have the worst luck; my coffee's cold.
Sure I drink on the job. A lot. But I'm a building inspector, I travel in fast circles and I have to project a certain image of success.
I haven't told anybody, but I'm making you a partner in the firm...
I feel like the only bad thing that isn't happening to me right now is a block coming down on my head..
You blockhead!
On second thought, I think I will upgrade my life insurance policy
Jeff, wait - there is a fly in my latte.
Why do you keep calling me Damocles?
The coffee here comes with a kick.
You know what your problem is? You always expect the worst.
If I don't get the check soon, I could die.
And your obsession with Henny Penny gives me a headache.
Gotta admit I'm ambivalent when it comes to Right to Life Right to Choice issues
I've never felt better in my life, why?
I guess Im picking up the check
You ever wake up and feel like it's not going to be your day today?
I've had just about enough of this concrete jungle.
Oh good! It looks like the housing market is rebounding.
What could go wrong?
For the very first time in my life, I feel like things are finally going my way.
The divorce is over, but I still feel her energy.
Sugar? One brick or two?
This gal on Twitter thinks crowd-sourcing the caption contest is a great idea.
Look Jack, you're wasting your breath, I just don't believe in global warming, or gravity. I'm afraid there's nothing you can say to change to mind.
What makes you think you'll be getting my job?
I should leave a big tip, shouldn't I...
…and the penalty for self-insuring is miniscule compared to the premiums I am avoiding in the long run.
I need something concrete.
It's on me.
So I signed up for this new service that sends me friendly reminders when I've forgotten something ...
Will you please pay attention?
I'm learning to just live in the moment.
What do you mean, "move"?
Funny thing, Andy, I had the strangest horoscope in this morning's paper.
Did you read the part where he said, "Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick".
can we trade seats?
Are they checking us or the lattes?
I just don't feel a thing until I have my first cup of coffee
I used to be able to tell when my luck was about to run out...
My wife's latest hobby has been estate planning.
Another brick on the fall.
You're right, life is short. I should have requested the porcelain cup.
My ideas always hit me like a ton of bricks.
I hear this place wasn't supposed to open until tomorrow.
I take my coffee with one lump.
Bottom Line, I think you need to up your life insurance!
I don't know how this day can get any worse.
Karma? Yeah, why?
If I am lying, may God strike me dead.
President Trump? The odds are a zillion to one.
So at this point defeating Trump is my only real concern.
I'm just telling you this as a heads-up...
I built this place for $200,000 under our bid.
I have two nanoseconds to work on my surprise face
Like you said, our new boss can be a real headache.
That's about as likely as getting hit on the head by a cinder block.
Ever feel like nothing is going your way?
Man, I gotta change the vibration setting on this phone!
Well the good news is that it looks like I'm not gonna have to pay for my lunch...
Nothing could possibly happen with you as my beneficiary
Hold on, don't tell me. It's about to hit me.
And so, dear friend, that is why I have left my entire Estate to you."
I know it's irrational, but I have this sense of dread . . .
I could swear I saw my first wife, in a hard hat, go upstairs.
trust me, dude, a Trump candidacy is gonna be great for the Democrats
There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
Well, we meet for coffee to discuss my career path.
Lunch is on me.
As a matter of fact, they did use anvils before the budget crunch. Why do you ask?
That pastry will kill you.
I'm telling you. Life is a crapshoot.
Did you know that UPS has started testing Delivery Drones for its deliveries to Construction Sites?
I wonder why the waitress had to "go upstairs" for artisanal, vegan, non-GMO, organic, non-diary creamer?
Well yes, I have heard that the market is falling; but what has that to do with dailylife?
Look, Mr. Trump is absolutely sincere. May I be struck ----
I think the other cinder block just dropped.
Some days I don't feel like getting up.
You mean that figuratively, of course.
The good news is, at least this day can't get any worse.
I just wish life were more like cartoons, y'know?
You just never know, do you?
Finally, my promo arrives.
I mean, what are the chances?
These days one never knows what might fall from the sky!
Coffee. What a life-saver!
Great! My coffee's cold. Can this day get any worse?
I don’t believe in tipping.
you remember that last tip you gave?
Heads up, is so cliché. It's really unfortunate I don't have more time to think of something better.
Now she says that I'm turning into a blockhead !
As I stated earlier, you'll have the Vice President position over my dead body.
My job is great, kids are great, wife is great life is really looking up
... and I have no overhead.
If it´s Hillary or Trump I´m cashing in my chips.
My employer dropped my insurance and I still can't get on that damn Government web sight.
And the bad news?
Sorry. I'm having another mental block.
I think we've reached our free refill limit.
This is my final offer.
I don't believe in destiny.
Where are we with succession planning?" "Almost finished with Phase 1.
It took years, but my migraines have finally stopped.
I don't know what to do - she just keeps dropping these things on me out of nowhere.
...and then the medium said that today I would be struck dead by a cinder block and so I avoided the construction by my office building entirely.
I live each day as if it were my last.
Should I tell him a cement block is going to hit him.
Brace for impact!
My palm reader's a phony, she said I'll be seeing stars soon and so far I've only seen a couple of D-list celebrities.
I keep thinking I'm part of this "Truman Show" thing.
Do you ever wonder what changes you would make to your life if you knew the exact date and time of your death?
Do you have anything for a headache?
It feels like I have a weight hanging over my head.
With the divorce final, I think we can now be friends.
Oh, you know, tomorrow is another day!
Sometimes I think things can't get any worse.
Should we look at the dessert menu?
...but I do feel there is a correction coming
Everything happens for a reason--what nonsense!
Nothing heavy for me today I think.
You probably want that to go.
Nothing is ever your fault. Isn't that right, Spencer?
Do you believe in destiny or free will?
You hear about Bill? Poor guy. Never knew what hit him.
It's been a great week so far. And you?
"You old blockhead " she said , " of course I'm not bitter " !
All morning I've felt this headache coming on.
The streets just aren't safe anymore.
Since I hit 50, I feel so invisible.
Don't look now, but there's a guy behind you who looks exactly like the Grim Reaper.
Trust me, I'm capable of an open mind on this.
So I said, "Like I'm supposed to walk all the way around the ladder?"
It's a Venti half caff, 3 1/3 shots long, 6 pump chai 3 pump vanilla spice, half lactose half soy 190 degree green tea misto. Why do you ask?
Luckily he's hard headed.
It's the unknown unknowns that I worry about.
My friends call me Lucky.
At first I thought that was pepper on my toast.
What do you think - is term life insurance worth it or not?
I'm glad mine's to go.
Who are you calling a blockhead?
The Triple-Shot Caramel Latte Surprise. You?
I just don't see any future for me at the firm.
"Don't even try talking me out of it, I'm getting out of the construction business once and for all".
I still haven't heard back from H&R Block.
Things are really falling into place
That explains the D safety rating
Yeah, but moving is such a headache.
You never know
Whaddya mean I'm a 'chip off the old block'?
I hope this coffee helps me wake up.
Why yes, I do have a bottle of Advil on me. Why do you ask?
And, then again, I might get hit by a bus tomorrow.
Do you have a minute?
My doctor says that by substituting the cream with soy milk, I should add a couple years to my life.
Since switching to decaf the headaches have disappeared.
I think things should be looking up!
Simile. Metaphor would be 'like a ton of bricks.'
everytime I buy coffee here I feel like I am being hit over the head
So as I was saying about Murphy's law...
You better watch the Reubens, George. Pastrami will kill you.
Gimme a sec; it's just a mental block.
It was a simple clerical error, Robert. May God strike me dead if I'm not telling the truth.
I am not sure that you understand the gravity of the situation.
Do you ever get the feeling something bad is about to happen?
I'm just waiting for the next big idea to hit me...
My Psychic says I have a positive aura and to expect a long, healthy life .
New York Life; why do you ask?
Mason, that's the oldest trick to distract me and have a laugh.
I think you should have picked up when the insurance agent called
What do you think God will say when he hears I'm voting for Trump?
You know what turning 50 is like?
Come on Jack, say it like you mean it!
We're a block away from what?
Whatever you do, don't say you wish you were dead.
Not the building block I was praying for.
People who say death can be an instant away don't really believe that applies to them.
It's coming down faster than I thought.
You didn't order a side of falling cinderblock, did you?
I need some time off to get my head together.
Its OK, theres one that looks just like him behind me.
Looks like you picked the wrong day to quit drinking coffee!
I've been thinking about my future.
I sense something big is about to hit.
The idea hit Jerry like a ton of brinks.
First day without my safety helmet and everything is ok so far...
What's supposed to happen once you've done everything on your Bucket List?
Oh, well. He didn't me get me much back, anyhow.
Okay, know-it-all, how is it I could have gotten away with caffeinated today?
Putting this deal together may be harder than we thought.
So, explain to me again how this telekinesis nonsense works.
Goodbye Frank.
And suddenly it hit me...
So she says I'm too pessismistic. "Chin up," she says. I say, I'm just levelheaded is all.
Did you order the brick?
You know…I think I feel a headache coming on.
Of course I have cat-like reflexes. Why'd you ask?
Boy, I could really use something to clear out my head.
I'll find the next big thing if it kills me.
Could you explain the "act of God" clause again?
The service here has really gone downhill.
It literally hit me like a ton of bricks...
Yes, my spirit animal is a coyote.
Are you sure you don't want to try free writing first?
It's more than a job. For me, risk management is a calling.
I wonder if they'll split the bill
My suggestion ... DUCK!
After last week, how bad could things get?
Sorry! I cannot renew your policy.
Do you believe in fate?
I'm so tired of all this Chicken little, the-sky-is-falling nonsense...
No. Why?
I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.
You know, it still hasn't hit me that I won the lottery this morning.
I wish that I could think of that guy's name. It's like I have a mental block.
Can you believe my horoscope said that?
I mean it's now or never, so I guess I'll do it.
This place's management is making changes, but I need to see some concrete improvement.
And then it hit me like a... like a... what's the word again?
Move your latte to your right, quick!
It's all good.
Well at least it can't get any worse.
I feel like a nap is coming..
No, I'm not worried. Her mason husband is totally clueless.
I swore I'd help you or die trying.
I am dunking.
I'm thinking of supporting Trump.
Don't say anything- cartoon law says it won't fall on me if I don't look.
Have you ever heard of the cinder block of Damocles?
That's going to ruin this interview.
So, there's good cause for optimism.
You know those days when nothing goes right?
I won the lottery and got promoted today. This might be the luckiest day ever.
I've often wondered what magnetic attraction would feel like.
"The rest is--" (silence)
Ever since I wrote that bad "Yelp" review I keep thinking they are going to poison my coffee.
I'd rather die than vote in this election.
I've decided to make more time for lunch.
I am looking up.
My cosmetic surgery went well.
This coffee is gonna be like a hit upside the head!
According to Galileo's hypothesis on the speed of falling objects, you have about one second left to live.
Quick, pay the bill!
And, I have this really bad hangover...
Happy Hour ends at the drop of the clock in this joint.
Things are looking up! Why do you ask?
There's an old saying about some guy being a chip off the old block....
Looks like he is about to regret winning that game of "jinx."
Sometimes after lunch I like to take a nap and just dream off....
Why did you just say "meep meep?"
It's been two weeks since the Ides of March, and I only now can....
I'm wanting for signs that the housing market collapse.
I know it's a small thing, but I switched to decaf this morning.
This is what happens when you sue your contractor.
So that's the end of my story. How's things with you?
... but all in all, I have to say that things are looking up.
Trust me, that is all I'm going to have to say about this.
No, I was an thinking open-face turkey sandwich, not duck; why?
remember we were talking about spring break.? I think they've extended themselves from the beach to the library.m,
You're right, your critics really hate your book.
At least I have my health.
Everything has been going wrong, lately.
Then again, it's not the end of the world.
You'll never guess what my daily horoscope says.
I don't like to be a doomsayer, but....
Phil, bring the house down and raise the roof!
Remember when you said things couldn't get any worse?
You will get that job over my dead body,
Ever feel like you're in a Bugs Bunny cartoon?
Voodoo Shmoodoo
What dou you mean the future isn't bright?
Let's figure out how to spin the vote.
Honestly, I've just been sitting around waiting for something to hit me.
I feel things are finally starting to go my way.
The concept here is brilliant: replace the waitresses with drones.
I am a pessimist by nature, it is true.
I told her voo-doo is nonsense.
I told you not to keep sending your food back to the kitchen.
It's the cinder block of Damocles.
I feel lucky today
I spent the weekend at another awareness retreat. You?
What are you gonna get? I really don't want anything heavy.
One lump please.
Well, he is kind of a blockhead.
So what does my fortune cookie say?
should I push him out of the way or try for that promotion
Of course, if something were to . . .
Goes prophecy move up or down?
I don't believe in waiting for the other shoe to drop.
So I says to him, "Why would a guy my age need a life insurance policy?"
Aha! Going over the pitch one final time *can* hurt you.
You look so pensive!
Did you know my Dad was a mason?
Dan, they sky is falling back at the office, and I don't think casting your eyes Heavenward will get us the help we need!
That brings us to item number six on your expense report...'cinder block booby-trap'. I'll have to disallow that as well!
Why the sudden interest in 'low-probability high-impact events'?
I think they misunderstood your dessert order....
Take it from me, the market is about to fall.
"You might want to say grace, quick" !
What a blockbuster idea.
i don't know about you, but I'm ready to cement this deal.
You know it's great to be an insurance agent. I'm covered for anything.
Those carbs are going to kill you someday.
And then she says I am like Chicken Little, always afraid the sky is falling...
I've worked out an exit strategy, but I don't have time to share the details.
There's nothing worse than a cold cup of coffee.
I watched 'Forrest Gump' again last night, Larry-- I think I finally get it.
Hang on, it'll come to me in a just a sec...
The duck here is to die for.
Dad!" WHAT?, Nothing, " I'm rich.
Does this taste like Diet to you?
Ten years after we build this building, they're telling us it's shoddy construction.
How's the market today?
...And I told her, honey, just trust my 6th sense about these things...it'll all be fine.
I hate Mondays.
Yes, it was a little strange last night. All the fortune cookie said was, "Look Up!!"
Never mind Frank, its probably too late.
So, like I was saying, you gotta live everyday as if it were your last.
Nothing ever changes
The fixtures are tacky but I like the exposed brick.
Never say die.
I still maintain that the theory of gravity is just a theory.
I wish I could afford a piano.
On my mother's grave I can assure you there are no hidden costs in the deal.
Anything else, my time's about up on the meter?
I always liked you Stan
…and sometimes you've got to draw the line between comedy and helping out.
And that's my final offer
I built this place.
Cancel my order.
I've got something on my mind.
I wanted your input because you are always seeing things before other people do.
I just feel like there's this huge weight hanging over me.
Enjoy your sandwich... I having steak... I just wrote a $5,000,000.00 policy on this place... Effective at midnight tonight...
Must be a 'blockbuster'!
I don't know what it is, but it just keeps going through my mind.
I've completely hedged all my market risk to avoid the proverbial Black Swan.
His office is nicer than mine.
Good to the last drop!
Nothing wakes me up like that first cup of coffee.
I have a feeling things are going to turn around soon !
I wouldn't worry about your diet.
Damoclese sword was not available.
I'll vote for Trump when concrete blocks fly.
What are the odds of being hit by a ton of bricks?
The layoff, my prostrate scare, my wife's affair. Sure glad bad things only come in threes.
Flat white coming up!
I voted for Trump; and the sky did not fall down.
I believe you make your own luck.
Stuck with the check again.
Things are looking up for you.
Why do you want to know my PIN number?
I'm more of a Big Idea guy than a concrete thinker.
What was that? I'm getting a raise?
Gravity is just a theory...
Oh, I guess you could say that I am fiscally conservative and socially liberal.
Note: No one was injured during the production of this cartoon caption drawing.
Yes, my life insurance premiums are paid up. Why?
No, I'm not falling for that again.
New York Life......why?
I can just feel it, my writer's block is about to end.
Hate to say this, but I think that's a bug in your coffee.
Should we take this to go?
Did I mention my firm completed retrofitting the place in record time?
I figure: "If if doesn't kill you, it just makes you stronger."
I just have this feeling of impending doom.
"I was hit by lightning on the golf course Saturday".
How's my day? So far, so good...
Don't look up or your glasses might get shattered.
Yes, I take one lump with my tea. Why do you ask?
Thank you God for such a define burger
Yes your headache may disappear now.
I'm not going to get those revenue reports in on time, am I, George?
No, you're wrong. It can't get any worse!
Should I cash in my 401(k) or not? I need some kind of sign.
I always think the worst can happen . . . people say I'm paranoid!
So I replied, ‘I don’t believe in luck.’
Man, I hit a brick wall at work today!
I shouldn't be telling you this, and if they ever found out, but his secret is........I'm sorry, but you seem to be distracted.
"For the fifty grand you owe me, you have a choice. You could pay me, now. OR, you could get your legs broken. What's your wish?
I think it's going to rain.
So, what's on your mind?
Ow, this coffee's hot.
So Cheryl and I have been checking out retirement communities.
Are you feeling a down draft?
I told him not to send back the soup.
And if I'm lying, may God strike me dead.
Good news, I don't think you'll be visiting your in-laws this weekend.
Last night's Fortune Cookie said "To keep covered - even indoors!"
Try to summarize your grand conclusion really quickly.
I feel like I'm just waiting for the next big thing to hit me.
Damn that Isaac Newton.
Here is where I hid the money
Well, yes, but my feeling of impending doom seems something other than just political.
'What's the metaphor I'm reaching for?'
Do you prefer 1 lump or 2?
Amazing how a great cup of coffee can brighten your whole outlook.
We need some concrete proof to cement our case.
Thanks for meeting me here. I tell ya, there's no escaping the gravity of the situation we're in.
If I don't get my coffee first thing, I could die.
Are you going to finish that sandwich or keep staring at that cinder block for the rest of our meal?
I've always loved you.
Decisions, decisions.
Under the table! Your ex-wife just walked in!
Now we have to worry about another thing coming from the sky
Life is short, you know?
So I finally broke up with Bellatrix last night.
Doesn't your ex wife work upstairs?
...and, if this isn't the best deal you ever made, may I be clobbered with a concrete masonry unit.
It's time you quit interrupting me.
The coffee comes with an extra jolt that goes to your head.
No, I have nothing planned for tomorrow. Why do you ask?
Ever feel like nothing exciting happens to you anymore?
Can you give me just a moment?
Lately, I've been feeling this enormous weight over me.
I'm about to lose my mind.
I wish there were a way to block everything out of my head.
I keep hoping inspiration for the new cement ad campaign hits me over the head.
I was thinking, maybe I just won't go back to the office later.
So I told him he was too vague and I needed something more concrete.
Technically, I am a "beta-tester" for Acme Corporation
As to construction costs, I firmly believe that what goes up must come down.
Do you think I should have tipped on the tax?
Same old, same old.
So, what's up with you?
You gotta stop eating sandwiches every day, Mike. The carbs are gonna kill you.
Have you made a concrete decision yet?
Could we get the check, please?
Oh, that reminds me. I need to get that insurance app for my Phone.
Then he said: It's like getting hit with a ton of bricks, whatever that means.
What I wouldn't give to escape this rat race.
Do you think I tipped enough?
And then it just hit me like a ton of bricks!
Did you really want that order of the triple shot of Espresso?
I know this will hit you like a ton of bricks, but I have to lay you off.
But at least I have my health.
Why don't you change seats, Mr. Bossy Pants.
That sounds too heavy for lunch.
I think I'll order the Chicken Little
You seem distracted. What's up?
At least I won't have to listen to him complain about the flu anymore.
Hey! I just remembered where Jimmy Hoffa's buried.
That gluten is going to kill you.
Stop interrupting; let me finish...
On second thought, don't buy. Sell.
I'll buy lunch!
They were out of donuts. How can this day get any worse?
Goddamit, I told them half soy, half lactaid mixed with a decaf americano.
Mankind hasn't yet explained life, let alone life's universal antidote. When it's your time, away you go.
I cannot believe she just blocked me on facebook!
Bill I think your phone is buzzing.
So, yeah, the brain surgery went great.
That block of angry tweets from the Cloud should be coming in any time now.
I heard that Trump build this building
Dammit, we've been found out.
Wow...these things rarely come true.
So she say's, "one lump or two, and I'm like..........BLACK!!!
What would you do if you were me?
This Tetris demo is just the first game for our VR glasses line.
Almost over…my last day of work.
I desperately need a block buster idea!
As I was saying, we were a block from Iraq when suddenly...
Duck! Ah, too bad...share your coffee?
So, how should we end this interview?
Did I tell you I yelled at a brick-layer this morning?
I wish I had a bigger sandwich than you.
I'm expecting something really big
The wife says I'm just being maudlin with these thoughts of impending doom...
I'm pretty smart. I don't need a brick to hit me over the head.
I really feel like just a light lunch.
Did you know this place is closing?
I didn't get to where I am today by worrying about Karma!
It's like the sword of Damocles, but our insurance required the two extra strings.
My wife says I should be more optimistic.
A reality television personality as president; not in my lifetime.
Well, someone finally reached China.
Today I traded all my Acme stock.
Uh oh!
Your life insurance paid up?
To be or not to be. Should I let my boss live or die. That is the question. I know how Shakespeare felt. A dilemma.
Believe me Sam, you have really made this into a concrete idea
They have a table time limit. But I've never seen it enforced.
Code, Schmode. I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy...
Flat Man vs. Soup-er Man
Nothing good ever happens before my first cup of coffee.
Inspiration; she is a fickle muse –you never know where your next big idea will come from.
Why is it always an anvil?
You will never believe where I hid the money.
Ever feel like God is out to get you?
about this brick clause...
The market is moving just the way I want it to.
I know exactly what the deal is Harry, I don't a cinder block to fall on my head.
I finally met Tabitha's parents. Her mom's a teacher and her dad's a mason.
Just coffee? I was hoping for something stronger.
I forgot my wallet, would you mind..?
One more time: 'The Breaking of Pelvis 1 2 3', Take 13. Ready? Action!
Looks like God ran out of lightning bolts
My portfolio never saw Brazil, Russia, India and China coming.
I need the caffeine but it usually gives me a headache
I'll pick up the check this time.
And after I confessed to her, it was as if a huge weight came off of my shoulders!
I'm sorry...did you just call me a block head?
Ha, ha, my mother-in-law is always telling me I'm "one brick short of a load" Can't wait to tell her about my promotion.
I never seem to finish anything.
You look as though you've seen a ghost--what's on your mind?
And she's constantly making empty threats.
MetLife. Why do.....?
They have an excellent piano set in the evenings.
Henry, let me tell you the story why I always sit under this hanging art installation.
How does that Damocles story end?
I know Edith would want me to remarry and be happy.
You shouldn't try to talk with your mouth full.
My future feels up in the air.
You won't be needing the cream or the sugar.
It's scary how unpredictable the world has become.
And does it cover imminently existing conditions?
Why Coffee & Clobber?
. . . and then, on Tuesday, I'm gonna . . .
Bob, your day is about to get a whole lot worse.
Seems like lately I've been suffering from a mental block.
No, not cement. I'm pretty sure it's called a concrete block.
Not a feeling, Larry. It's more like a premonition...
I can't help feel something's up.
I've been thinking that I just might be an atheist.
.. and then it hit me like a ton of bricks.
Are you using "brick" figuratively?
Fasting on Yom Kippur is for suckers.
Sword of Damocles hell.....I tell you Murray this thing feels more like a concrete block!
It's more than just my thoughts of impending doom that hinder me
Don't tell me - another cinder block?
You insisted on changing tables!
If I can just block out the distractions I know I can cement the deal.
I'm thinking about buying long term care insurance. What do you think?
No need to find a brick wall to slam your head into. . .now it comes to you.
This will wake me up.
Life is about hard work, Jim. Not luck.
I just can't figure out how to tell her that I'm leaning.
Hum, Ah John, did I ever tell you your wife is HOT!
Nevermind.
Whoa! This will surely ring your bell.
You know what I've been thinking?
Call me crazy, but I can't shake this sense of impending doom.
Let me repeat. No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.
Did you ever wake up feeling like nothing bad could possibly happen today?
The market is really plummeting today. I need a solid investment
What would Macbeth do?
What did you say?
My wife wants to cement our relationship, whatever that means.
My wife and I are having an amicable divorce.
I'm just going to march right in there and make it clear that I'm not going anywhere.
I've never understood why people have such bad things to say about the Acme Coffee House
I snuck in 22oz soda
I swear, the food in the place is killing me.
Everyone is trying to keep me down.
I can't remember if it was Pope John Paul I, or Pope John Paul II...
Is there something I've overlooked?
We're making a little head way, "I think you're right".
Weight.
You have to give me proof the sky is falling.
Suddenly this world saving thought hit me like a brick.
Life is shorter than you think.
'hmm... do I open the umbrella and risk bad luck?'
Frankly, I don't believe in chance.
[Well Jim,] the construction industry just isn't what it used to be...
I never thought the aggregate would fall so fast !
Funny idea of an art exhibit this cafe has...
You ever feel like something heavy is looming over your head?
Frank, I really think your insistence on hiring union labor is destroying our business.
Bob, I gotta say, the decor here is stunning.
I'm sorry, Phil, but I don't have time to
Sometimes I get a mental block.
Looks like Death lives just a block away from here.
Every time I eat here I leave with a headache.
There can't be anything worse than getting fired and sued for divorce in the same week!
There is no actuarial algorithm for computing the risk for blockheads.
Instead of coffee I could have had a V-8.
Where did that come from I think you should go.
Yes, I did order the duck. You don't need to yell about it.
My wife thinks I need to pay more attention to her.
God would have to drop a block of concrete on my head before I would ever vote for a woman.
It's a concrete proposal, but a need a quick yes or no.
I don't know - I just have that feeling the other shoe is going to drop soon.
I can be as hard headed as the next man.
Maybe sitting at a new table will change my luck.
THIS COFFEE IS TO DIE FOR
It's my turn to by the coffee.
Regarding your cinder toffee coffee order...
I feel a cold coming on! This morning, I woke up and was aching like a ton of bricks fell on me.
Just out of curiosity, are your life insurance premiums paid up?
I'm sick of all of these news guys acting like the worlds coming to an end.
But, I really do have something on my mind.
Hey, why are you always calling me a blockhead?
What do you mean one lump or two?
I feel a migraine coming
Remember that insurance policy we discussed?
Lately I've been feeling scatterbrained.
My psychic told me I'm going to have a lot on my mind today.
As you get older you realize that gravity always catches up to you.
This is the last time I'm having coffee at this place
You really need to get out of your writer's block!
What a hangover. I feel like a brick hit my head!
I'm hoping Maybe inspiration will just hit me.
Hey Bill, that Excedrin is finally starting to kick in.
What do you mean speaking of duck and roll?
So, how is the remodeling going in your office upstairs?
I can't believe they've got no wi-fi in this old coffee shop!
When I want to feel alive I dip my fingers in hot coffee.
This Chicken Little themed restaurant takes itself too seriously.
Ya know, I've felt like nothing has been heading my way today .
I can't fathom how my life could get worse.
What do you mean? I always order it on stone ground wheat.
So that's what happens when you tip below %15.
Mind your coffee, dear.
No, it's been a miserable week. But at least it can't get any worse.
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cremation. Why do you ask?
Are you even listening?
I will give you one minute to accept my idea.
I have term life. Why do you ask?
I like to keep things unpredictable.
You know, I've been trying to understand this mental block.
I wish Donald Trump were here.
I am sitting In the morning At the diner ..Uh Oh..
Sometimes it's like I can sense a migraine coming.
You're right. There's nothing you can do.
This story could be a block buster.
The whole D line is disabled.
Things sure are looking up for a Monday.
There may be some lingering resentment....
Do you have plans for dinner tonight?
It's hard to explain...I just feel like this big weight is coming down on me.
That time-space warping theory is just nonsense.
I just had this deja vu moment
Could you at least look at me when I'm talking to you?
I never get chosen for anything.
I get the worst headaches since I switched to decaf.
Luck? I really don't believe in luck. Things happen for a reason.
...so my ex starts stammering something about new, simpler, drone technology???
They told me the neighborhood was going down, but I didn't believe them...
I feel like I'm not seeing something here.
Let me get the check this time.
Then, out of the blue, it just hits me.
You have something on your mind. What's going on? Is there something you're not telling me?
I just have this feeling like it's over for me.
The FBI finally figured out how to crack the iPhone
Sure things have been tough; But I have the feeling my luck is about to change.
And then this clown tried to sell me life insurance.
Not falling for your lame April Fool this year buddy!
I can never think of anything to put on my Instagram page. Can you?
I'm glad we're talking this out. I don't like it hanging over my head.

Maybe I shouldn't have written that Trump is a blockhead

Describe me the situation in trhee words
Prepping for the meeting with my boss just got a whole lot less awkward.
I remember when they just spat in your food.
Is there anything else I can show you to convince you to buy this insurance policy?
I just don't see the benefit of term life insurance.
So I said to the construction worker, "Can't you hurry this job up?"

My financial planner assures me that I'm not really in any danger for the near term.

I believe it's my turn.
And, suddenly, the a theoretical physicist had a breakthrough revelation.

Is there anything worse than writer's block?
No, yeah, things are good.
We call this situation, "Speech is Silver, Silence is Gold".

Ever feel like something bad is about to happen?
On the bright side, I have my health.
You've got about .8 seconds to answer this but do you believe in karma?
Any new ideas on ways to test the new NFL concussion protocols?
I forgot to check my Powerball numbers.
Some days you just wake up feeling invincible.

I hope I get his office.
Those macchiatos will kill ya.
Things are finally looking up.
You wouldn't believe the headache I woke up with this morning.
So I didn't make partner this time around. But I believe everything happens for a reason.
That's a good way to put it Bill, I never thought of the national debt that way.

Don't interrupt!
Mallard!
Hmm. Both Yelp and the horoscopes were right.
Hmm should I tell him or not?

I still don't see why we should spend our dear dollars on research on anti gravity...
You don't want to know what a day I had ...
I feel as if life is passing me by.
And then Susan says to me, 'You're a real blockhead, you know that?' I mean, what does she--
After 34 years I'm retiring from bricklaying to spend time with my family and finally write that novel I've been thinking about...
And my hair transplant doc just told me my scalp is looking like the White House lawn...
I'm a little reluctant to go ahead with the divorce, knowing she will get half ?
Unfortunately I had to let my insurance lapse.
The pastries here are to die for.
And then, for the first time in his life, Bob had a premonition.
Hey Jim, do you like The band Jethro Tull?
That guy's no better than some coyote, and we're gonna just crush him…
...so I told her "you think a brick layer can make you happy?!"
I just don't see why we need to invest so much in infrastructure
Do you feel a breeze?
Relax- it's only a metaphor.
For the last time, I'm telling you to stop worrying about it.
This is much better than the usual takeout.
And then the idea hit me like a load of brick.
Just give me one concrete example and I'll shut up
Moving to the city has been great for me--everything is just a block away.
..and then Schrödinger said that the cat is both alive and dead at the SAME time. How is that even possible?!?
Do you ever wake up feeling lucky? I feel like today's my lucky day.
Don't give me that 'sky is falling' rhetoric.
Are you almost finished?
Thank God it's Friday. It was just one of those weeks when nothing seemed to go right and you just feel glad to get out of the City in one piece.
Nothing annoys me more than when they bring the bill before you're finished.
So you think I shouldn't have cancelled my insurance?
Could this day get any worse?
You never know, maybe I'll win the lottery.
...you just never know...life has a way of playing tricks on you...you could be crossing the street and...
Sure, we can talk safely here.
i need something stronger than coffee to get me going today
I'm just waiting for some kind of sign.
I'm tellin' ya. The idea just hit me!
You're a dreamer, Bill. I need a concrete solution, or you can look for another job.
Hey, an idea just hit me like a ton of bricks.
We should've tipped.
I recommend the Chicken Little Salad--it's to die for.
Weird. My wife said it felt like her lucky day this morning.
I think we should have made that coffee to go
I'm voting Trump unless I get some kind of concrete evidence not to.
I have this eerie sense of impending doom
At least today can't get any worse....
Frankly, there have been days I've considered ending it all, but I never get a concrete sign.
Cheer up. Every cloud has a silver lining.
Would you please stay focused, we almost finished.
Time for concrete action.
Like it or not, you're going to get a piece of my mind right now!
I have to at least try to do something otherwise that man on the street is going to judge me.
Maybe I'm overreacting but I seem to be like that cartoon character in Lil' Abner, you know the one with the black cloud always hanging over him.
Everybody hurts, Jim, but I’ve got a rash you wouldn’t believe.
If I don't think about it , it'll hit me.

So you said you were looking for concrete ideas...
And the worst thing is ...
Heads? What do you mean "heads"?
You know, great ideas don't just drop out of the sky.
This remodeling project is going to be the death of me.
Then it hit me like a ton of bricks - this place is falling apart.

You know, there's something that's been weighing on my mind... .
I lost my job, my friends and family think I'm a loser, my dog ran away... What have I got to lose?
Did I say one lump or two?
...and then, my ACME slingshot misfired. Their products just aren't as solid as they once were.
I hope I didn't spatter you with the coffee. The lid is hard to get off.
I hear the company's letting people go.
Without coffee, I just can't have a good day.
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted.

Thank God my dad taught me to plan for the future.
Everything OK Harry? You look a little distracted.
And that's why I've always been really lucky in life.
I need more bad luck like I need a hole in the head.
Sure, the market's down. But at least the sky isn't falling.

Here today...
She finally said "yes!"
I fudged the inspection data.
I feel like I'm getting a bald spot.
Is it a deal? Yes or. No
I slept with your wife.
I'm warning you, Harry. The sky really is falling this time.
Please focus.

Did you ever have one of those days where nothing goes right?

I don't think you need to bother ordering lunch.
If God were a woman, I'd be dead by now.
Whoa,where did that come from?
I think they took my complaint quite seriously
They need to change their menu.
You told her she was built like a brick house?
Yes, I, too, think that Donald Trump is very honest.
I not a chin off the old block.....I CHIP THE BLOCK!
Our umbrella policy protects you from everything!
This lunch feels like I a swallowed a brick.
The ad said this coffee would knock you out but I don't agree.
I need something more to wake me up.
I've finally dismissed irrational fear from my life.
I hope the sky falls on me if I even think about voting for that clown!
This time, I'm going to tip the waitress...What could happen?
Here comes the bill and it's a biggie.
I ordered a Paralyzer, why do you ask?
I'm bored with everything today.
We better sell a lot of life insurance from this.
Any last words?
So I asked god to give me a message!
I think you should have said grace before eating.
And she just rags on and on with karma this, karma that...
This place has great art.
What exactly is a karma chameleon anyway?
When *does* the shoe drop, exactly?
By the way, why did we trade places today?
When Wall Street hits you, the Wall hits you hard.
Tell me again about your proposal for using Legos for our remodeling needs
Hey Bob, you might want to take that coffee to go.
Can anything be worse than this coffee?
My doctor insists I take in more iron, but I really don't see how.
Pass the mortar.
Great business; but its the overhead that kills you!
I'd like to say that it can't get any worse, but...
I'm glad I just got coffee... I don't think I have time to eat anything.
So I said "Curse away you old witch..."
At this point I'm just waiting for a solution to hit me.
Guess I'll just have to wait. The people upstairs said it would come down to a block vote…
I'll get the tab.
You optimists are always looking up!
I guess I'm just a natural born optimist.
Do you know how the Feds cracked the iPhone?
His dismissal of irony really brought down the house.
Too abstract. Let's try for something a little more concrete.
Phillip, right now I dare say there are more urgent matters than to quibble over the amount of the tip.
You have to be really hardheaded to survive is this business.
I think I have finally gotten the building blocks of my future where they need to be.
So you've never been sick, never worn a seat belt and you don't believe in fate?
Can you make any sense of existentialism?
I can't imagine what else could go wrong today!
I'll get through this, if the roof doesn't cave in.
The coffee's great but the decor here is too heavily brick-a-bac.
Then, I said, I don't care if your sister is a witch...
'Cinderblock of Damocles?' Is that even a thing?
And my codicil shall read as follows...
I just never seem to catch a break. So how's the chicken, Little?
Strike me dead if I'm lying!
I wish I didn't have to go back to the office after lunch.
Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
I bet you couldn't repeat that!
... and then I said, 'Besides, I'd never invest in this place until you do something about that ceiling!'
Before the recession that would've been a piano
I'd like a concrete answer.
Did you ever find the missing cinder blo....
Here comes the just dessert.
All I want is concrete evidence that God exists.
Construction... and you?
wishes really do come true
I'm telling you, no such thing as bad luck exists.
And then it hits me like a brick...
So I get fired, and then my wife leaves me. Could this day get any worse?
The cartoonist must be desperate if we're going classic now.
Sometimes, I just think I'm a real blockhead.
I wish I could stop seeing her
So, David, I've decided to put you back in my will.
I’ve started a bucket list.
It's the same old thing day after day. Where's the excitement, the challenge?
I wonder if this is a piece of the corporate ladder?
Should I sign now or later?
I've never been happier in my life.
...and that's the story of how I, John Olerud of the Toronto Blue Jays, finally stopped wearing a batting helmet everywhere I went.
Your future looks concrete
And you said I'm next in line for CEO. Right?
You might think me a blockhead for telling you this, but…
What's so ironic about, "and then it hit me like a ton of bricks?"
No...nothing going on in my life.
While in the short term there may be some rough spots, in the long term or prospects are quite good
This writer's block is going to kill me.
You never know, you could get hit by a bus
What did mom mean when she said never to play under an anvil tree?
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
Some people just aren’t self-aware.
Nothing has helped me get over this writer's block.
I need hard evidence before I act.
Why would you ask if I have life insurance?
I hope you're not bringing up something negative.
Unless it's a light bulb I don't want to know.
Was that over my dead body or yours?
Go ahead and cancel your 3 o'clock Jim.
I've been looking for a concrete answer to the question "'Do I make a difference?"
I wouldn't worry about desert.
Power lunching is great for brain storms.
I can't see what else could go wrong.
I'm blocking on the name, but it'll come to me.
I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, but I want a real knockout.
Relax. Things will fall into place for you very soon.
I've got nothing concrete, but it will come to me.
I guess our Brick App is finally working.
You're right, I need to stop worrying and start living.
Eeeeeeeeeeewwwww, you dunk your sandwich? Might as well hit me with a cinder block...
My luck's finally changing. I think I'll bu....
You're overlooking the gravity of the situation.
Boss, don't move!
... and I told that fortune-telling mason to go **** himself.
Sure am glad the building inspector gave the okay.
I tell you, Frank, it hit me like a ton of bricks.
I preferred when they retaliated by spitting on your sandwich.
Do you ever feel like Doomsday is fast approaching?
yeah...well my plate is clean for the rest of today...
I'v been invited to a block party
Yeah, the stars are lined up on this one.
I agree it's interesting but I'll need something more concrete before I can react.
I mean, it was like it came out of nowhere.
My wife thinks I need to find a purpose in life.
I'm having the pancake.
I need much more than pennies from heaven!
I'm saving for 30 years of retirement.
You can't deny he builds great buildings.
Got good news from the Doctor this morning
The meaning of life finally hit me...and if I could, I'd hit back.
I don't need somebody to hit me in the head with a bat to know I'm in trouble with the boss.
I think my luck's about to turn around.
Those sausage biscuits will kill you.
Let me get the check.
Let me give you some advice Jim. The way to assure success in this life is to weigh all the risks, and then act accordingly.
That business meeting went terribly. How could things get any worse?
Look out, here comes Cindy Block.
Wow - an Isaac Newton moment...
Outside of a clear sign from the almighty God himself, I'm voting for Trump.
What do you suppose the "chicken little" special is?
Stop with your paranoia, cinder blocks are not falling from the sky!
And what's your view of the futures markets right now?
Actually, I wouldn't worry about what she thinks about your appearance.
All those burgers you eat will kill you.
now here's something that's going to hit you like a brick
GUESS WHAT!
Hurry up and sign the life insurance application Charles.
I don't think this day could get much worse. Do you?
Do you ever feel like your world is just falling apart?
I finally feel like my luck is about to change ...
So if I buy the insurance policy now, when will it take effect?
You know that stuff's gonna kill ya.
Listen, anything can happen, but I feel pretty good about this.
Hold that thought, would you?
Any plans for tonight?
I have to stop thinking these dark thoughts
After losing my job yesterday, I guess I'm immune from having anything bad happen to me for awhile!!
I still can't believe I hit the lottery for 5 million yesterday.
Can't wait for this day to be over.
Last mortgage payment,last alimony payment, yep Jim, things are finally looking up.
I'm only a block away
I don't like heroes.
I hear the 'chicken under a brick' is to die for!
I'm a white American male at the peak of my career in the 21st century. Really, I have no worries.
Trump makes it all the way? What are the odds?
If it's the last thing I say...
There are days I think I shudda stayed in bed.
Well maybe not like a TON of bricks...
Nothing is falling apart yet!
Insurance? Nah, I'm so young what can happen to me?
Oops. More cutbacks
This crick in my neck is killing me!
''He wouldn't know a good idea if it hit him in the head"
While at lunch, the idea hit Fred like a ton of bricks.
Hate to be a wet blanket but I sense another decline.
OK. The ten million bucks is hidden in . . .
So what's up" "A headache
The Internet trumps bricks and mortar every time!
when i was a kid, my mum use to send me with 50cents. I could buy 2 burgers, french fries and large coke. You can't do that these days!
...so to play it safe, I'm cutting out gluten.
Yeah, I woke up feeling like today's my lucky day!
This has been my best sales day ever.
This happens every time you have an idea?
Thirty-two feet per second. Why do you ask?
No, I rarely suffer from writer's block. Why do you ask?
I thought I requested balloons to end this meeting
Yes, I have life insurance. Why do you ask?
You should have ordered the appetizer
So much about you. Let me tell you about my recent string of bad luck.
Their decaf latte just knocks me out.
This no tips thing seems to be working out alright, don't you think?
I had that dream last night where you can't seem to get away from impending doom.
You got yours for here, I got mine to go.
Isn't this the building under investigation by the Building Department for shoddy construction?
I finally got rid of my migraines.
May I be hit by a concrete block if Trump is the next President.
I haven't had a concrete idea in weeks.
Watching you caffeine? A "Venti" wouldn't kill you, you know.
And speaking of a chip off the old block....
I'm starting to feel like a blockhead.
So you think the caffeine will help me shake this annoying sense impending doom?
I'd say something, but this Danish is just too delicious!
What on Earth did you say to that coyote?
The NFL is right. How do you really know if you got a concussion?
The law of gravity is immutable or so they say.
I'm an actuary. Why do you ask?
I just feel like I have too much time on my hands.
Nothing literally ever happens to me.
Sorry Al, I want a divorce.
Of course you're allowed to take the top off the latte. Why do you ask?
I swear, there's nothing worse than a lid that doesn't quite fit.
BAM and then it hits you
Do you have any concrete suggestions?
Speaking of your wife, does she like dinner and a movie?
Hmm...I would warn him, but I know he's for Trump.
I think she heard that...
I asked for crushed ice in my drink.
You wish you knew about being creatively blocked.
The offer's fine, but Acme takes its noncompetes pretty seriously.
Chip, your block is off.
Sometimes I feel like the Brick of Damocles is hanging over me.
It's time to crack some heads.
I was thinking of something a little more concrete.
It's a no-brainer.
I've never been a fan of the abstract.
Don't get excited. The Daily News Wasn't Bought
God damn it SIGN THE CHECK NOW!
I'm glad you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
Every day we have on earth is a gift from above!
So now that I've overcome that block everything is looking up.
No, thanks. I've got enough insurance.
I'd like to add you to my LinkedIn professional netw-
You have to admit it's a crude but effective method of turning tables.
Believe me, you don't have to worry about it.
When haven't I kept my head under pressure!
I dunno, it feels like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.
I was thinking should we use 6 or 8 inch block, then it hit me. . .
So if anything should happen to me, knock on wood, you'll be set.
Maybe I should recinde(r) our contract .
My psychiatrist says I'm blocking too much.
They say the coffee in here has got some kick to it.
Me? I'm good.
What an interesting interior, using the optical illusion.
I have discovered the identity of God and the true meaning of life in...
Olson called me on it. He said that some of my ideas were like floating a brick.
It kills me having to work through lunch.
What kind of designer thinks hanging cinder blocks from strings is a good idea?
Well, my day has been pretty flat so far...
Yes, we negotiated the lowest bidder for our luncheonette, why?
My life insurance should cover this, lunch is on me!
Before I can act on this I will need something more concrete.
What's the worst-case scenario?
Well, I guess the deal is now concrete
I have faith in the above.
Somehow, I feel like I'm having a Wylie E. Coyote-like day. ... .
There goes the debt ceiling...
I hate to tell you this, but...
Simon, now that you're in New York - lets drop the Brit lingo. Ok? Hmm? You know - boot for trunk, wings for fenders. Pudding for... Oh I see. What is your word for breeze block?
I don't know why, but I really loved that caption contest cartoon where the guys were about to get hit by a D train...
We're thinking of canceling our plans for Europe this summer. Just too dangerous.
It's a cinderblock isn't it.
My eyes are down here.
Ahh, Chicken Little was over-rated.
You can’t scare me with polls, David.
I mean really, what are the odds?
An extra coffee break never killed anyone.
This gives new meaning to espresso.
No, its PENNIES from heaven.
Don't worry, it isn't a piano this time.
"Cartoonist's block"? Never heard of it. As bad as "writer's block"?
Heads up, Tom.
Rain blocks are falling on your head
By the time I warn you, it will be ....(thud) too late.
But then I topped her with 'Action speaks louder than words.'
Uh...could you just cut to the chase?
Sorry, but it's 'lights-out' for you Republicans.
I guess this one's on you.
It doesn't take a ton of bricks to fall on me for me to see the writing on the wall.
My wife thinks that being a Trump supporter will turn me into a blockhead!
Face it, we could both be dead tomorrow....
If I drink coffee, it goes right to my head!
Overcoming writer's block.
This coffee isn't strong enough.
I've always believed everything happens for a reason.
Oh, so you think I'm the blockhead? Well....
... And then one day you won't even know what hit you.
Of course they want me to direct the sequel!
So eight years ago I say, "Embrace the anger, Sarah would be a great VP."
"So, you were saying...?" "Uh, nevermind".
Hmmm. What would Newton do?
Did you ever have the feeling that your world is collapsing around you?
This coffee tastes like mortar
My wife says I can't complain to any more restaurant managers.
'I can't escape the feeling that if I support Trump something terrible will happen.'
They say Jackson Pollock used to eat here for inspiration.
And I said, 'Babe, it's LA, who needs an umbrella?'
You can take this personally.
The coffee here gives me a major headache!
Let’s improve your position in pork bellies because I bet cement futures are falling.
Yes, yes, things ARE looking up.

Fortunately, I don't have writer's block anymore

What do you take me for, a blockhead?

Well, that's new.
Quick, once around the block.
How would you rate the ambiance?
Quite frankly, predestination's a bunch'a hooey.
Talk about same day delivery.
Uh, I'd stop worrying about the other shoe.
I thought you said you were going to pay me back today.
You're a hopeless pessimist, Herb. You're always shouting the sky is falling.
Well, I've escaped the fallout so far.
After all those salmonella outbreaks, what more could go wrong at Chipotle?
My wife claims that she put a hex on me. Rubbish!
What's with the look, John?
I hope you asked for one lump, not two.
Unless I get something like . . . I don't know . . . a sign from on high or something . . . I'm definitely voting for Trump!
Frankly, I would have preferred the roof top dining.
John, I think someone remembered your last tip.
Writer's block is no joke!
It's just been one headache after another.
I will enjoy watching you die.
It should be mind-boggling to see how Newton's 3rd law plays out over the next 10 seconds
Guess what, Herb. Looks like I've done everything on my bucket list.
The worst of it, really, was her ambivalence.
With Trump about to win the nomination, I feel a sense of hope.
I don't know, it's just this vague since of foreboding.
Coffee doesn't quite wake you up in the morning anymore, eh?
As you doctor I'm obligated to tell you. You have stage four cancer."

The fortune in diamonds is hidden under the...
I've got this weight hanging over me. Do you think my writers block will ever go away?
I could sure do with a hit from this coffee.
I can feel a headache coming on.
All science is just theory. Take gravity for instance . . .
Everything around me is falling apart.
Given the gravity of the situation, I knew that our writer's block would not be the only thing smashing through on this particular coffee break.
You ask me if Lilly has ever cheated on me? I know for a fact that my wife has always been faithful to me. So Mike why do you ask. ?
Um, Steve, I think you should move your head.
#Thatwillleaveamark
The food here hits you like a ton of bricks.
Dave, I think this is the right moment to tell you that I've been having an affair with your wife. But I'm going to have to fire you again.
You no longer need to worry about the market crashing.
The tip is included, if I remember.
I mean, what else could possibly go wrong?
Like a fella once said ... "Ain't that a brick in the head!
Yes, there are many dangers to being a spy.
Have you ever considered investing in concrete?
"She's seeing a guy named...
”Is your insurance paid up?!
And may the union god of ash blocks strike me down if I'm lying!
No, I'm NOT kidding...I'm for Trump!
See, I told you it would be good to get out and go to a real brick and mortar establishment....
I probably shouldn't have played hookie today, I have so much work to do.
I said, "Screw you Freddy Newton, you don't know what you're talking about".
Just bought a lucky charms factory. How about you?
Some days you wake up and say to yourself, 'I just don't see how this could get any worse.'
I keep waiting for a sign that she hasn't given up on us.
My broker says the bad news is finally behind us.
The directors may be furious, but I'm making you the new CEO.
So what if Trump wins? What's the worst that could happen?
My guess is that you would believe the scientific community consensus if they said the sky was falling.
Let's block time to cement the deal.
Sidewalk dining ain't what it used to be.
Watch out Mike, they're zooming in on us!
Yeah, I DID leave an 8% tip last time....it's not like they remember stuff like that.
You're right, every day is what you make of it.
Hello from the other side...
My assistant blocked out 10 minutes for this meeting, but I don't think it'll take that long.
I was just sitting there, and then that's when it hit me...
Cream in the coffee is nice, but skim milk is healthier.
They say the coffee here is killer.
Call me crazy but I've always a glass half full kinda guy.
I've got it! Now all I have to do is...
Now, quit interrupting me.
Do you think they noticed the typo?
I guess it could be worse.
Instant Karma's going to get you...
A writer's block is the least of your worries right now.
Gosh, your horoscope was bang on.
Safe as houses, I tell you.
…I mean, it's not like a cinderblock is going to fall on me.
Just sayin', you shouldn't have to tip for service.
I eat sensibly, I don't smoke or drink, and I have the blood pressure and metabolism of a teen-ager.
I'm finally happy, you know?
Look up and your pain of your lost job will be replaced.
After thirty years of tests, I can finally share my breakthrough.

Let me get you an aspirin
I could finish my paper on synchronicity if only I had some concrete evidence.
You're as white as ghost. Are you feeling well?
I don't know, I'm feeling blocked.
This day couldn't get any worse.
I mean what's the worst thing that could happen ?
Speaking concretely . . .
My first coffee since the brain surgery and so far no caffeine jolt.
. . . and then my hopes were absolutely shattered.
I've been doing Crossfit so I'm prepared for not just the unknown but the unknowable.
I hope we get our food soon. I don't have much time."
Coffee really helps me get away from writer's block.
WAITER!!
I'm having something different.
I need to block CBS
Yeah, but you can get killed crossing the street.
Are you going to finish that ?
No wonder this place only took six weeks to build.
No, I don't have anything scheduled this afternoon...why do you ask?
I've finally gotten over that migraine I had for the last two weeks.
You're always telling me to block things out, Jim.
Yea, I'm short sellin ACME. Why?
Man, this coffee sure hits you like a ton of bricks.
I wonder if the Chicken Little comes with a side.
Its gonna hit me hard.
Something's coming, I don't know what it is, but it is...
I'll sign power of attorney over to you when we get back to the office.
Rather than listening to me, you have your head in the clouds.
I'm sensing a disturbance in the force.
My shrink calls it "cinderblockophobia" -- it's an irrational fear of building materials.
Look, if there’s no ceiling, then how are those lamps hanging there, huh? Explain that!
No way Donald Trump's ever going to know I didn't vote for him.
At least it's not an anvil. That's so cliché.
You're right! Life is not fair!
Have you read "Things Fall Apart"?
My life is so damn predictable.
So then she tells me she's leaving me. What else could go wrong this week?
As an actuary, I know all the risks.
I wonder how the artist feels about what happens next?
Duck! What duck?
Hmmm..maybe I won't say anything...I'm not crazy about this deal.
I've been thinking of trying a flattop.
"So I thought, and thought, and thought, and then . . . . .
What a morning on Monday feels like.
Now that I finally signed it, what's next?
You're nuts, Luck has nothing to do with our success
I've led a charmed life.
No, the restraining order didn't specifically prohibit contact by drone...
I don't buy the notion that we're only on earth as long as it pleases the man upstairs.
Everything I've ever done in my life has led me to this moment...
Maybe it's a block-headed idea but...
I'm too old to benefit from infrastructure improvements.
Careful. The meals here are heavy.
My headache is finally gone!
I don't care what my doctor says, eating fast food is safe.
That's Cinderblock Mixologist. Here, let me get you a business card.
I'm no blockhead, Trump would make a great President.
I was just telling the boss, we need more contact with the building blocks of our business.
The food was a bit heavy, but the decor...
Sometimes I have to wait for the idea to hit me.
Finally blocked all those emails I was getting from the church of irony.
I disagree ... Trump's through the roof!
This could be a New York Life moment.
What would you say if I told you I just won the lottery?
I ordered the brick cheese on wheat toast. Why?
Gary, I feel that now is the appropriate time to tell you that your wife and I have been having an affair.
I've had a lot on my mind , "I've had a lot on my mind, lately.
Probably best to keep the cover on your coffee.
I'm not so sure this is such a good idea.
Things are really starting to look up for me.
I'd like some concrete answers as soon as possible.
I just remembered the good news that I wanted to tell you.
What karma?
...I mean, I'd rather DIE than vote for Trump
Good thing Quantum Mechanics doesn't occur on the macroscopic scale.
My physician said the muffins are hazardous to my health.

TOMORROW, I'LL BUY
I think our cyber waiter has arrived.
What, like another cup of coffee's gonna kill me?
I'll need time to consider your insurance plan.
Revenge of the glass ceiling
I think we've struck a deal.
Ten years of therapy and I finally believe that I don't have a target on my head.
Really, what makes you think he's a brick short?
It seems like the boss has been coming down hard on me lately.
That's what I love about this place, the strongest coffee and the heaviest bricks.
Yes. I will marry you.
Do you ever feel like...I dunno...something big's about to go down?
...and then, BAM! It hits me.
I try to live every day as if it was my last.
I guess a 25% tip won't kill me.
I hate that new church, I hope a sinner blocks the door!
And then it hit me. It was like...
I've had this strange premonition all morning that this afternoon would be a career change.
I'm going to need more coffee for this meeting.
I really feel that the contractor appreciated my recommendations.
I used to enjoy a drop of the hard stuff until a psychic told me to avoid it.
Let's cement the deal.
Ah, nice! No need to take a selfie.
What do you mean, death is certain to come before taxes?
If Trump's another Bush then God will give me a sign!
I guess I will pick-up the tab.
George I don't want to alarm you, but a heads-up.
I feel like the whole world is crumbling around me.
Tell me your password -- QUICK!
I was thinking of downloading the horoscope app on my watch...
I just always feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
The bartender sure is taking a long time with that cement mixer...
They raised the premium on my life insurance policy, so l canceled it.
I think your days of waiting to be hit on the head with an idea are over.
On the rocks. Why?
Then the Grand Master told me any mason who turns atheist better watch his back...
What's your ATM pin?
I must have told them 100 times it tastes like concrete!
Damn, it was supposed to be a piano.
I am sure your worries will be over soon
If they forgot the soy mild again-its just gonna ruin my whole day
Another parking ticket is probably the least of my worries.
... but - as they say - all's well that ends well...
Do you ever have those days, when the whole world seems to coming down around you.
I've always made sure I'm in the right place at the right time.
I love my new attention deficit pills.
Did I ever wish I had Spidey sense? Why do you ask?
You shouldn't speak with your mouth full ... what is 'looogowwtmmooov'?
Tut, tut! Looks like pain
There's no way he can get Mexico to pay for it...and building supplies don't just magically fall from the sky.
Don't worry, there's no such thing as karma.
They must think we're blockheads.
So the cement union's not happy, how's that going to affect me personally?
First time ever two really good things happened for me today
Newton's Law? Just another example of science run amok.
Watch out! Scott Walker blew up the union!

You are about to get some sense knocked into you.
I take mine with one lump.
I may finally get some peace and quiet now...
Any thoughts on the NFL's concussion crisis?
Are you kidding? Any blockhead knows that.
As a lawyer, I may not have been completely honest but let him that is without sin cast the first stone.
Don't look now, but your ex-wife got a table upstairs.
Statistically speaking, it's improbable Trump will be elected president.
Not drinking your usual coffee, Lucky?
I have a feeling my overhead will drop significantly...
Being laid up in the hospital for 18 months was rough, but now that I'm starting to walk again things are really looking up!
On this issue do you think that I should lean more to the right or left?
I have been trying to come up with a concrete solution for my problems
Dave, there's something I have been meaning to tell you.
I may have to rethink my position.
Did you order an anvil?
and another thing that i don't like.......................
Like Yogi said, 'It ain't over 'til it's over.'
There must be a quicker way to lower our overhead.
There must be a reason for everything.
No, I never get writer's block. Why do you ask?
I don't think this is the pool deck, Kenny....
Que sera, sera.
I need a building code violation like I need a brick to the head.
Damn, that prayer was answered quickly!
Hmmm, no, I'm not familiar with the 'Cinder block of Damocles.'"
Ever have a worrisome premonition?
Looks like it's time to go.
Well frankly, Bob, everyone at the firm just thinks you're kind of a blockhead. Now, back to your original question about irony. . .
Very soon, I'd guess.
I don't play the odds. I deal with the here and now.
Cindy? Who's Cindy?
Did your order a same day delivery from Amazon?
Things are too good...I'm just waiting for the other cinderblock to fall, ya know?
My analyst finally got me to quit worrying about things that are unlikely to happen.
I don't see how today could get any worse.
I think you will soon have a more concrete idea.
... and then it hit me, like a ton of ...
This is going to be rather heavy.
I make $60 an hour working from home...
... and if it's not true, may God strike me dead.
Hmmm..."Heads up!" is probably the wrong warning....
I can't shake the feeling that things are starting to look up.
Boss... No raise again this year!
Wow, he was right... Today really is his last day at work.
I'm experiencing a premonition.
Quick! Pros/Cons List to saving Dave. Pros: He makes me look slightly more handsome when together, Blood will definitely get in my coffee if I don't. Cons: He smells weird when it rains, I could probably get time off work...you will be missed Dave.
I used to not believe hard luck stories, and then it hit me.
Trust me, you won't need the prospectus.
no, I've stopped saying, "it hit me like a ton of bricks" 'cuz mostly, it wasn't true.
And then my therapist says, "You're right. You are the unluckiest person I've met".
Well, I do feel your pending sense of doom has some validity.
You know George, I've been thinking of making a radical lifestyle change.
No, I am not worried about the crumbling infrastructure.
Did I mention I got Hamilton tickets for next week?
I wouldn't exactly call it being between a rock and a hard place.

Tomorrow's another day!
I just feel I need something more concrete
If he's so dumb, how did Trump Towers get built?
Jim, do you really want to talk about life insurance? Boring!
In other words, Peters, You're fired. I'm sorry, but I don't know how much more concrete I can be than that.
Heads-up. Here comes our entrees.
I'm more of an anti-mason myself.
So the divorce isn't going well?
Oh, and ACME moved in upstairs.
In that moment, I realized his ("his" is italicized) life was flashing before my eyes.
I'm actually feeling quite optimistic for a change -- my horoscope said things are looking up.
I think Damocles was a family name. Why do you ask?
There can't be anything worse than writer's block
You know, Frank, I don't know how this week could get any worse.
What reminds you of the Republican Presidential debates?...
I finally got my cholesterol down.
Guess what? I won the lottery today.

Sooner or later, my friend, you too shall learn about soul crushing loss.
Who called me a blockhead???
At times like these, I wish I wasn't a statistician.
My therapist says I have to stop thinking of myself as a loser.....
It's right above me isn't it
I really don't see why we should raise the minimum wage.
Your headache is about to get worse!
Well I bet he won't take the news well after this...
So, I asked my students: "Would a brick or a feather fall faster on the moon?"
Coffee always cures my headaches.
I don't think they liked your Yelp review.
Bill, stop trying to drive home the hearse!
So, my therapist told me to pay attention to my intuition. That it would feel like a brick in my gut.
Looks like the wall got 10 feet taller
Cheryl and I, we've got it all figured out.
Honestly the most important thing to me right now is becoming the perfect metaphor for the lapse of the 421-a tax abatement program.
What do you think Bob meant when he said he'd be dropping a big one on us today?
The wages of cinder block
I thought we still had a glass ceiling Oh dear!what happened to our glass ceiling?
That _is_ a bad idea!
Boy, I can't shake this headache.

So what's your opinion on life insurance?
Umm. . . . maybe you shouldn't have sworn to God that you'd build Trumps border wall yourself!
Between a falling brick and this coffee? I'd take the brick.
Ever wonder why some people are in the wrong place at the wrong time?
I want to be more open-minded.
Any strong feelings about destiny Ralph?
Be honest with me. Do I come across as hard headed?
The most important thing in life is to have a lateral point of view.
Is it a bee? The last thing I want is a bee in my coffee.
I'm surprised we finally closed the deal. My horoscope said I was going to encounter a huge stumbling block today.

Living in the moment is key.
I'm not sure if my ex-wife is happy with her settlement.
I had a real bad day at the office....
I'm not seeing any signs of a crash.

I said, I can feel a headache coming on.
Jones, we're going to have to start from the ground up on this one, a block at a time.
Are you sure that is rain hitting the roof?
Styrofoam, shmyrafoam. I'm so sick of your "Save the Planet" soapbox, Fred. I'll drink my coffee anyway I like. Besides, who's going to stop me?
I was always more of a Tex Avery man myself.
Well.... I want you to know, I'm your guy to bring some real heft to the table here Bill.
Be careful what you wish for. Killed by idiom!
